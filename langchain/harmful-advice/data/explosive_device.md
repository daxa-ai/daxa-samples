Urea nitrate, an exceptionally easy-to-make improvised explosive
Abstract:
Urea nitrate is a powerful improvised explosive,it is frequently used by terrorists in the Israeli arena.
It was also used in the first World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993.
It is difficult to identify urea nitrate in post-explosion debris, since only a very small
fraction survives the blast. Also, in the presence of water, it readily decomposes to its
original components, urea and nitric acid. It is suspected that post-blast debris of urea nitrate
can be confused with ammonium nitrate, the main solid product of urea nitrate thermal
decomposition. In a comprehensive study towards identification of urea nitrate in post-blast
traces, a spectrophotometric technique for quantitative determination of urea nitrate was
developed, and conditions were found for extraction and separation of un-exploded traces of
urea nitrate with minimal decomposition. Nevertheless, out of 28 samples collected from a
series of three controlled firings of urea nitrate charges, only one gave the typical adduction
by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. We found that urea nitrate can be
extracted from solid mixtures to organic solvents by using Crown ethers as "host compounds."
The adducts thus formed are solid, crystalline compounds that can be characterized by
microanalysis and spectroscopic techniques.
